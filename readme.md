## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://not-twitter25.herokuapp.com/)

Ruby on Rails (or just “Rails” for short) is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language. Since its debut in 2004, Ruby on Rails
has rapidly become one of the most powerful and popular tools for building
dynamic web applications. Rails is used by companies as varied as Airbnb,

This project has teached me a lot about ruby and rails from configuration, setup, generating model and controllers, scaffolding as well as creating application that has feature such as email activation, image upload and micropost, follow and unfollow and much more. The most important part of this tutorial is to understand the MVC structure and how to generate files that are needed.
